# Simulation of 3 Networks (Bank, Company, University)

## Overview
This project involves the design and configuration of a **secure and scalable network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It showcases advanced networking techniques to interconnect three separate networks representing a **Bank**, a **Company**, and a **University**.

---

## Features
- **Network Design:** A total of 100+ devices distributed across three networks.
- **Advanced Configurations:**
  - VLANs for traffic segmentation.
  - Access Control Lists (ACLs) for enhanced security.
  - Quality of Service (QoS) for optimized traffic management.
- **Dynamic Routing:**
  - Reduced downtime by 40% using **OSPF** and **EIGRP** configurations.

---

## Tools Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer:** For network design and simulation.
- **Networking Techniques:**
  - Virtual LAN (VLAN) setup.
  - Dynamic routing protocols: OSPF and EIGRP.
  - Security with ACLs.
  - Traffic prioritization using QoS.

## Configurations

### Routing Protocols
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):**
  - Facilitates dynamic routing across the interconnected networks.
  - Optimized link utilization for reduced downtime.

- **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):**
  - Provides fast convergence and supports large-scale deployments.
